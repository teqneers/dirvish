<H2><A NAME="acronym">Is "Dirvish" an acronym?</A></H2>
<P>
No.
<P>
If you want to pretend it stands for <B>Dir</B>ectory
<B>Vi</B>rtual <B>S</B>torage <B>H</B>ost or anything else
you can invent go right ahead.  I won't issue a fatwah.
<P ALIGN=right><A HREF="#TOP">back to top</A>
<H2><A NAME="name">Why the name?</A></H2>
<P>
Because what makes this backup system distinct is that
it writes to spinning media.
That reminded me of the whirling dervishes.
<P>
At first I rejected this for several reasons but I finally
decided that it was just too anti-PC and
anti-(<I>so-called</I>)-multi-cultural to resist.
<P>
Think it of a fast rotating backup system and take it for a spin.
<P ALIGN=right><A HREF="#TOP">back to top</A>
<H2><A NAME="logo">Is there an dirvish icon or logo?</A></H2>
<P>
Not yet.  I am not an artist.  If you are and have an idea
for one I'll be glad to consider it.  While I won't pay you
for your contribution I would give credit where due.
<P ALIGN=right><A HREF="#TOP">back to top</A>
<H2><A NAME="diff">What is different about dirvish?</A></H2>
<P>
Dirvish uses cheap disk space to maintain the appearance of
multiple copies of source file trees.
Traditional backup systems write to tape.
<P ALIGN=right><A HREF="#TOP">back to top</A>
<H2><A NAME="mirror">What about disk mirrors?</A></H2>
<P>
Disk mirroring (RAID-1) and RAID-5 (not really mirroring)
are good at protecting you from certain kinds of disk failure.
 Unfortunately they can't protect the data from human error,
OS and hardware induced filesystem corruption,
or anything that destroys the computer.
For that
you need a copy of the data that is isolated from the cause of failure.
<P>
Ideally the backup server should be in a different building.
<P ALIGN=right><A HREF="#TOP">back to top</A>
<H2><A NAME="tape">What about backups on tape?</A></H2>
<P>
Look at the price of tape drives, robots and blank media.
If you are already doing backups to tape,
When was the last time a tape or tape drive failed?
Compare that with the price and longevity of disk space, case and
controllers.
<P>
By putting your dirvish server in a separate location from
your production servers it becomes an off-site backup.
<P>
That said, you may still want to make tapes.
With dirvish you can relegate tapes to off-site storage and
long-term archive so you will make far fewer of them.
And you can make the tapes from your backup server during working hours
with no down-time.
<P ALIGN=right><A HREF="#TOP">back to top</A>
<H2><A NAME="netload">What about network load?</A></H2>
If you have used network backup systems you may have seen
the backups saturate your network.  I know I have.
Dirvish shouldn't do that.
<P>
Dirvish uses rsync for network transfer.
Where an incremental tape backup requires only requires
transmitting the changed files, dirvish only requires
transmitting the changed parts of the changed files.
So while the result is full backups every time,
the volume of data sent is even less than
incremental tape backups.
<P>
In fact the volume of data transferred can be
sufficiently low that backups over the internet are
feasible.
<P>
In some cases the network will actually be faster than the
disk subsystems.
When that is the case the <B>whole-file</B> parameter
will actually improve overall performance at the expense of
network load.
<P ALIGN=right><A HREF="#TOP">back to top</A>
<H2><A NAME="many">Why so many images, don't I only need one?</A></H2>
<P>
In an ideal world you wouldn't need any backups.
I don't always know that I need a given file restored on the
day it gets trashed.  Often it will take several days before
I even notice it.  Most users are much worse.  Someone
deletes or modifies a file or deletes a whole directory and it
turns out a few weeks later that someone else still needed
it.  One or two versions just don't cut it.
<P ALIGN=right><A HREF="#TOP">back to top</A>
<H2><A NAME="license">What does dirvish cost and how is it licensed?</A></H2>
<P>
Dirvish is free.  The license is OSL.
<P>
I would like to know if dirvish is helping so if you are
using it please let me know.  Also let me know about any
bugs you find or improvements you might come up with.
I would be particularly interested in getting statistics on
real-world capacity requirements.
<P ALIGN=right><A HREF="#TOP">back to top</A>

<H1 ALIGN=center>Capacity Questions</H1>
<H2><A NAME="howbig">How much space do I need for dirvish?</A></H2>
<P>
A reasonable rotation program
should need about one and half to three times the space
of the original filesystem.
This is very dependant on
the rate of change for a given directory tree
and the number and age-range of images in the rotation.
<P>
Consideration should be given to the nature and probable
change rates of a given backup area and the value of older
data.  Project areas and home directories may have
relatively low rates of change but are subject to sudden spikes
and their data is important enough to retain for extended
periods.  Conversely /var has a high change rate but the data
is really only valuable for one or two days.  So a vault for /home might
want thrice the space of the production area to hold images
ranging from one to three months or longer while /var may
only need fifty percent more space in it's vault and be
expired after 2 or three days.
<P ALIGN=right><A HREF="#TOP">back to top</A>
<H2><A NAME="mkfs">How should I build the filesystems for dirvish?</A></H2>
<P>
Dirvish can back up almost any filesystem.
Only the vaults on the backup server have any specific
requirements.
<P>
Only regular files will be shared between images.  Device
nodes, symlinks, directories and other file types will be
recreated for each image.  This means that there will be a
lot more inodes used in a vault than the source filesystem.
<P>
The best filesystem type for dirvish would be one that
doesn't set a fixed number of inodes at build time.
The vaults will also need to be built with a filesystem type
that supports hard links.
<P>
While a journaling filesystem is a recommended the journals
can have an adverse affect on performance.  Dirvish and
dirvish-expire do a lot of filesystem meta-data changes.
This will stress the journal which in some cases is not as
well optimized as one would like.  Experience has shown that
some journaling filesystems perform extremely poorly
under dirvish.  While no benchmarks have been made the
difference in speed has been as high as 10:1.
I would not recommend data journaling.
<p>
Using a filesystem
type that allows resizing makes it much easier to adapt to
the real world requirements of each backup set.
<P>
If you are building filesystems with a fixed number of inodes
such as UFS or ext2 you should create the
filesystem with a bytes per inode value that is half or even
just a quarter of what you would normally.
Because directories will not be shared it may be good to use a
smaller block or fragment size to reduce internal fragmentation.
<P>
I would also recommend using RAID-5 arrays for the vaults.
You are going to have a great deal of important data here
and disk-fault tolerance is a good idea.  RAID-5 isn't
nearly as expensive as mirroring and should be more than
fast enough.  Logical Volume management is also a good
idea for the vaults as you will probably wish to resize some
of them over time.
<P ALIGN=right><A HREF="#TOP">back to top</A>
<H2><A NAME="2much">With so many images, won't it use too much disk?</A></H2>
<P>
Because dirvish shares unchanged files between images the
actual disk space used is considerably less than you might think.
For most filesystems only a small percentage of files
will change over a period of time.
<P>
The <B>dirvish-expire</B> utility
will automatically delete old images
based on their assigned expiration date.
If you execute this regularly (see cron) each vault will soon
reach a steady state where it grows very slowly in response
to the growth of the clients.
<P ALIGN=right><A HREF="#TOP">back to top</A>
<H2><A NAME="link_count">Could linking between images be limited by a maximum link count?</A></H2>
<P>
Yes.  But you are unlikely to ever come close to the limits.

<TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;<TD>
I can remember a version of UFS that had a link count limit
of 1023 but I doubt current versions are so limited.  I
haven't checked the commercial UNIXes but an examination of
the 2.4 Linux kernel source shows that link counts are stored in an
unsigned short so in theory would be limited to 65535.
The 2.6 kernel is expected to raise this limit and use
unsigned long (32 bit).
Each filesystem type has it's own limit as shown in the
table.
Performing a quick test I determined that indeed I could
create exactly 32000 hard links of a file on ext2.
<P>
What this means is that on most of the filesystems even if
you had a file with 100 hard links (busybox perhaps) you
could still support over 300 images sharing those links.
</TABLE>
<P>
In the event you are using a filesystem type that has a risk
of hitting the limit you could change hard links on the client
to symlinks.  None of these filesystems have limits lower
than 126.
<P ALIGN=right><A HREF="#TOP">back to top</A>
<H2><A NAME="save_space">How can I save space?</A></H2>
<P>
First make sure you aren't backing up useless files.
The exclude patterns can help there.
<P>
Look at the dirvish logs.  They will show you what is
changing.  When I first started using dirvish I found
web browser caches were a constant source of change.
There was no reason to back them up so I added exclude
patterns to block them.  Spool areas are similar sources of
waste.
<P>
Set reasonable <B>expire-rule</B>s in the configuration files.
<P>
Some applications provide choices regarding file layout.  A
particularly good example is email.  Because a changed file
is not shared large mbox mail folders that change daily
can be responsible for a considerable amount of backup
space.  Transitioning to maildir format means more small
files but those files can be shared across images as long as
they remain in the same status and folder.  Such
applications often have global configuration files in which
system administrator can set a desired default that most
users will not override.  Similarly there can be an
advantage to rotating log files more often.
<P>
Examine the logs.  Some services will create log files in
places you don't expect.
Adding them to the exclude list is a workaround.
Moving them to /var will correct the problem
and make your system more robust.
<P ALIGN=right><A HREF="#TOP">back to top</A>
<H2><A NAME="spike">Why would dirvish suddenly need more space?</A></H2>
<P>
Because dirvish saves space by sharing unchanged files
across multiple images changing many files will cause
dirvish's disk usage to spike.
<P>
Some of the things that can cause this are:
<UL>
<LI>updating a software package.
<LI>restoring a directory tree without preserving timestamps
and permissions.
<LI>recursive chown, chgrp or chmod.
<LI>sometimes users will update lots of files all at once.
<LI>relocating or renaming a directory.
<LI>leaving a temporary file around overnight.
</UL>
It really is a good idea to have enough free space to
weather a usage spike.
<P ALIGN=right><A HREF="#TOP">back to top</A>
<H2><A NAME="full">I'm running out of space what do I do?</A></H2>
Delete images.
<P>
Usually it is the same files that change over and over.
Because of this deleting intermediate images
may save nearly as much space as deleting old images.
<P>
Really old images can be archived to removable media and then deleted.
<P>
Sometimes the pressure is transient.
A spike may be the result of one image having captured
a temporary file such as a web download.
In such a case the spike will go away with that one image.
If someone recently changed a large number of files
that will cause a spike in the disk usage.
Such a spike will form a new plateau until the
older images are expired.
<P>
If your rotation just won't fit examine your exclude lists,
expiration rules and consider adding backup space.
<P ALIGN=right><A HREF="#TOP">back to top</A>
<H2><A NAME="gzip">What about compression?</A></H2>
<P>
Compression is a wonderful thing but one of dirvish's
primary goals is transparency.  If dirvish compressed files
you couldn't do a transparent restore.
<P>
Because of the file sharing between images compressing
individual images into compressed archives is unlikely to
save you space and will break the transparency.  Experience
has shown that the disk usage of dirvish is vastly less than
that of compressed snapshots.
<P>
It may be worthwhile to use a filesystem that supports
transparent compression such as e2compr for some vaults.
<P>
It is worth remembering that more and more applications are
storing their data in compressed formats such as jpg, ogg,
mpeg and gzip'ed XML (office suites).  If the files are
already compressed it won't save space storing them on a
compressed filesystem or compressing them externally.  These
compressed format files will also defeat the hardware
compression found on tape drives.
<P ALIGN=right><A HREF="#TOP">back to top</A>
<H2><A NAME="dirvfull">What will dirvish do if it runs out of space?</A></H2>
<P>
Dirvish will output a message to STDERR that it thinks it
may have run out of space and will remove the incomplete
destination tree.  The meta-data including log files will be
left to assist with debugging.
<P ALIGN=right><A HREF="#TOP">back to top</A>
<H2><A NAME="fullfail">What should I do if dirvish runs out of space?</A></H2>
<P>
First, delete any failed image.
If dirvish actually runs out of space and cannot complete a
backup image that image should be deleted.  It will be
missing files and have other problems that would cause
successive images to not share correctly.
<P>
You may wish to delete some of your images or enlarge your
vault filesystem.  That is of course your call.
<P>
See the section on <A HREF="#full">running out of space</A>
<P ALIGN=right><A HREF="#TOP">back to top</A>
<H1 ALIGN=center>Questions about use</H1>
<H2><A NAME="maint">How much maintenance does dirvish require?</A></H2>
<P>
Very little.
<P>
Dirvish, dirvish-runall and dirvish-expire will report
errors when detected.  Running them under cron, even in
quiet mode will still cause email notification on error.
<P>
Dirvish-expire will use the expire options to
manage the rotation of images automatically.
That mainly just leaves monitoring the disk space to ensure
that you don't run out of room and making archives.
<P ALIGN=right><A HREF="#TOP">back to top</A>
<H2><A NAME="restore">How do I restore from dirvish?</A></H2>
<P>
Each image is a complete copy of what existed at the time it
was made so all that is needed to restore from an image is
to copy the files.
It is essential to preserve ownership, permissions and
modification time of restored files.
<P>
Rsync is a very good way
but scp
or streaming tar or cpio archives from the backup server
will work as well.
<P>
It is also possible to do a read-only export of a dirvish vault using a
network file system such as NFS or CIFS/SMB.
This or network mounting the source directories on the
backup server will allow the use of a simple copy command to
restore files.
It should be remembered that NFS over UDP does have a
measurable error rate so exercise caution doing large
restores over NFS.
The permissions of
all the files in a vault are the same as the source location
so there is little security risk to doing so.
It might however be better not to give users access to this as it
will encourage lazy habits.
<P ALIGN=right><A HREF="#TOP">back to top</A>
<H2><A NAME="locate">How can I find what versions of my files exist?</A></H2>
That is the purpose of the dirvish-locate command.
<p>
You first need to identify the file you are looking for.
Examine the source tree or one of the dirvish indexes (you
instructed dirvish to create indexes, right?).
Optimally you want a perl regex pattern that will only find
the file you want.
<p>
Let us suppose i'm looking for a version of my .muttrc file.
I would use the pattern <b>/jw/.muttrc</b> The slashes have
no special meaning and the pattern is anchored the at the
end so this won't match a .muttrc.orig file.
The dirvish-locate command would look like this:
<PRE>
# dirvish-locate home '/jw/.muttrc'
2 matches in 29 images
/e/home/jw/.muttrc

From this we can see a partial history of that file.  Now i
don't have to look in every image to find the version i
want.  I can either pick a version or look at one image per
version to decide which one i really want to restore.
<P ALIGN=right><A HREF="#TOP">back to top</A>
<H2><A NAME="archive">How can I make archives from dirvish?</A></H2>
<P>
You can use any utility that will make an archive from a
directory.  Feel free to use tar, cpio or dump.
It is even reasonable to burn CDs or DVDs if your data will fit.
The nice thing is that this won't interact with
the production systems so you can do this during working
hours.
<P ALIGN=right><A HREF="#TOP">back to top</A>
<H2><A NAME="db_support">Does dirvish support database backups?</A></H2>
<P>
Dirvish supports arbitrary pre and post processing commands
on the client and server.  This means that you can
pause a database during backups or have dirvish create a
database dump just prior to backing up the dump directory.
